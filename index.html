            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I have an affinity for Italian culture.  I lived there briefly when I was a child, I have gone back to visit as an adult, I love cooking (and eating) the food, and I even study the language. So, I want to talk about it! And share some of my experiences. Buckle up:  the roads are wild!</p>

               <h2>Experiences in Italy</h2>
               <ul>
                  <li class="boldHeading">Quando ero giovane</li>
                  <p>Quando ero giovane (when I was young), my family moved to Gaeta, just outside of Naples.  I was about 5 when we moved there and 7 when we moved back to the States.  So, it was a short stay and I was a little young to take full advantage of all Italy had to offer.  But I got to eat a lot of pizza, pasta, gelato, and one of my favorites--mozzarella di buffala, which is mozzarella made with buffalo milk, and it's pretty much the best thing ever.</p>
                  <li class="boldHeading">Viaggiare in nord</li>
                  <p>Viaggiare in nord (traveling in the north of Italy) as an adult, I really only got to see Florence and Venice for a short time, but in that time I ate my way through both of those cities. In Florence, we had "must try" sandwiches from inconic <a href="https://www.allanticovinaio.com/">All'Antico Vinaio</a> and un'aperitivo at a record shop/restaurant on one of the piazzas.  In Italy, a typical aperitivo is a pre-dinner appetizer and cocktail hour, used to socialize with friends and start your appetite for the main event of the evening.  The rest of the time in Florence included grabbing some quick gelato, perusing through old book stores, and haggling in the leather goods market.</p>
                  <p>In Venice, we ate seafood, seafood, seafood, more seafood, seafood after that, and some other stuff too. At <a href="https://acquaemais.com/">Acqua e Mais<a/>, we got some classic Venitian street food of fried calamari and sardines on polenta packed into a paper cone.  Really, we got fresh seafood at every stop, but we also had an amazing vegetable forward meal at <a href="https://www.lazucca.it/en">La Zucca</a>, including a pumpkin sage flan that tasted like Thanksgiving in the form of fluffy custard. There was also beef carpaccio, squid ink pasta, boat rides, and beautfiul blown glass.  I highly recommend Venice.</p>
                  <li class="boldHeading">Viaggiare in sud</li>
                  <p>Traveling in southern Italy is an entirely different feel.  For starters, I drove throughout the trip and I can attest to a particular brand of lawlessness on the roads of Naples and the surrounding areas.  We also stayed in a town just outside of Naples and, at night, the kids seemed to own the city, traveling in large groups and shouting through the streets.  Lawlessness aside, we got to see some family friends we hadn't seen in 25 years, and we had a pasta making tutorial from a real life nonna italiana.  We made a huge family meal of lasagna and ate at a table under a lemon tree. We didn't make it farther south or get to spend nearly as much time in southern Italy as I would've liked, but it was a spectacular time.</p>

               <h2>Learning the Language</h2>
               <p class="italianItalics">Parlare l'italiano &eacute molto divertente!</p>
               <p>Alright, first lesson.  I've been studying Italian for a little over four years at this point, and I'm no expert, but I do know some good grammar rules.  The sentence above means "Speaking Italian is very fun!"  Let's break it down and I'll explain a couple points of grammar and syntax I've learned.<p/>
               <p>"Parlare" means "to speak," l'italiano" means "the Italian," and "&eacute molto divertente" means "is very fun." So, even though "parlare" literally means "to speak," in the context of this sentence it can mean "to speak" or "speaking," and it sounds more natural in English to say "speaking."  The word "parlare" is actually a verb in the infinitive form in Italian.  The literal translations of verbs in this form are "to do something," and while there is a verb form for the ending "-ing" in Italian, nine times out of ten you use the infinitive form to translate a verb ending in "-ing" in English.<p/>
               <p>"L'italiano" is a contraction of the word "the" and the word "Italian." In this case "the" would be "il" but articles in Italian are often attached to the noun they precede when the noun begins with a vowel; it sounds better to Italian ears.  Another thing to note about "l'italiano" is that it doesn't literally translate to "the Italian language," but it's implied.  Also, when using a noun to talk about a subject in general, Italian nouns typically need an article to precede it. For example, when you talk about Italian as a subject you would say "the Italian," or "l'italiano."  The rest of the translation is pretty straight forward. "Molto" is "very" and "divertente" is "fun." You can probably guess what "&eacute" means.<p/>
               <p>So there it is:<p/>
               <p class="italianItalics">Parlare l'italiano &eacute molto divertente!<p/>
               <p>Learning Italian is very fun!</p>

               <h2>Making the Food</h2>
               <p>I love eating Italian foods, but making them is just as much fun.  It's hard to beat the coziness of pasta boiling, tomato sauce simmering, a bottle of red wine, and some Italian kitchen music fiiling the room. Let me just share one recipe I make all the time.</p>
               <p>Spaghetti Carbonara</p>

               </figure>
               <p>For this dish to make about four servings you need the following ingredients:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>400g dried spaghetti</li>
                     <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
                     <li>1 medium onion</li>
                     <li>8oz bacon</li>
                     <li>4 eggs</li>
                     <li>8oz grated parmesan</li>
                     <li>salt/pepper to taste</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ol>
                     <li>Start by getting a pot of water with a good pinch of salt boiling for the pasta.  When it's boiling, turn it down to simmer to wait for the next steps.</li>
                     <li>While waiting on the water to boil, slice the onions and dice the bacon.</li>
                     <li>Get a medium skillet on medium heat with olive oil coating the bottom.  When it's hot put in the onion.  This recipe says 1 cup of oil but use your best judgment.  It should be enough oil to really coat the onion.</li>
                     <li>Cook the onion until it's soft and lightly browned, then add the bacon.  You will cook the mixture at this point until the onion and bacon are very browned, stirring occassionally.</li>
                     <li>While the onion and bacon are browning, turn the pot of water back to a boil and add the pasta.</li>
                     <li>While the pasta, onion, and bacon are cooking, crack the eggs into a small bowl add half the paremesan and stir well.</li>
                     <li>Everything should fully cooked around the same time at this point.  If the onion and bacon are getting too browned, turn down the heat so not to burn them. Once the pasta is ready, turn off the heat, drain the water and return the pasta to the pot.</li>
                     <li>Add the egg and parmesan mixture to the pasta and stir it up a little bit.  Then add all the contents of the pan into the pasta, parmesan, egg mixture, and stir everything up well. The bacon, onioin, and oil mixture should still be piping hot.  This cooks the egg and parmesan mixture.</li>
                     <li>Salt and pepper to taste and serve.  Add the remaining parmesan as topping to the indivual servings.  You could also add parsely, red pepper flakes, grated lemon, or whatever sounds good.  Enjoy.</li>
                  </ol>
